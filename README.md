# hackpad
This respository was created by RAQuig for the project "Hackpad" by the charity Hack Club.
It is designed with three keyboard switches and USB input.
The repository currently includes:
    --> KiCAD files (.pcb, .prl, .pro, .sch, .sch-bak)
    --> 3D Print Files (.glb, .stl)
    --> QMK Configuration Files for firmware (potentially unstable release)
    --> The Bill of Materials (BOMCSV.csv)
